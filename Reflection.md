This project gave me an issue becuase I had trouble compiling the project with Visual Studio and getting the uWebSockets to work for the simulator. After plenty of troubleshooting, I find out that a lot of people were having trouble with the Windows implementation of the project. After consulting with the forums and my mentor, I tried to give Docker a try. Still no luck. Finally, my mentor suggested I try the Linux subsystem new to one of the most recent updates to Windows 10. That worked like a charm. CMake and uWebSockets were extremely easy to install, and the subsystem allowed for easy compilation of my C++ project. I will definitely be using the Linux subsystem in the future for my C++ projects.

In a PID controller, 'P' is the proportional term where the steering angle is proportional to the CTE multiplied a factor of Tau. A 'P' controller alone is only marginally stable becuase it will consistently overshoot. For this project, I chose a Tau factor of 0.2 for the 'P' term because, though I didn't actually test it, I suspect that a really small Tau for the 'P' term wouldn't take corners very well, especially at higher speeds.
